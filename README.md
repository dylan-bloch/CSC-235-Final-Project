This is the code for my final project for CSC 235

## About my Final Project

For my final project in my Physical Computing class I created a playable Tetris board using an Arduino Uno and neopixel LED lights. 
The lights were arranged into a matrix on a piece of plywood and that is how I was able to address all of them when creating the game. 

For a more in depth look at the visuals of the project here is the behance page I created for it.
